# CNTA-Algorithm
_CNTA team's (Hanoi University of Science and Technology, 2012-2017) playground for hackerrank problems_

### Submit instructions

#### Folder structure
Each problem would have a folder inside the root folder of the repo: `($repo_root)/($problem)/($hackerrank_username)`. For example:
- `($repo_root)/2D-Array/tongtunggiang/`

In the root folder of every problem, there would be a README file with the problem's description. Folder creators (a.k.a the first one who solves a problem) should be aware of this.

#### Commit instruction
- The repo only has one `master` branch. All solutions for problems must be committed to this branch.
- Creating other branches is not prohibited, however, there is no need to push those branches to the remote repo.
